**1. Overview of App Functionality**

FindFlik is a community-based lost and found platform that allows users to:

* Report lost items
* Post found items
* Communicate with other users via in-app chat
* Coordinate the return of lost items

Users can interact with each other to help return items to their rightful owners. Once an item is verified through chat and agreement, the original owner may pay a reward, and the item may be returned via a delivery partner.

> **Note:** Currently, no payment gateway has been integrated into the application. All reward or compensation transactions are handled outside the app.
