## 1. Overview of App Functionality

FindFlik is a community-based lost and found platform that allows users to:
- Report lost items
- Post found items
- Communicate with other users via in-app chat

Users can interact with each other to help return items to their rightful owners. Once an item is verified through chat and agreement, the original owner may pay a reward, and the item may be returned via a delivery partner.

> **Note:** Currently, no payment gateway has been integrated into the application. All reward or compensation transactions are handled outside the app.
